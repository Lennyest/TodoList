# Rust To Do List
Simple terminal todo list, using the dialoguer crate and standard library to read/write files. Extremely simple, but works well enough.

## Building
Requires Rust
Clone the repository and run "cargo build", then "cargo run" to start it.

## To-dos for the To-do List
Add a way to check todos to mark them as done, but still have them there.
